        <p>Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] (listen); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, and the best of his time. [4] Kohli holds the records for scoring most runs in T20 internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to a number of India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time.[5][6] During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament.[7] In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game.[8][9] His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.</p>

        <p>He has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as the ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and has won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year. Additionally, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Khel Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.

            In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN,[10][11] and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes.[12][13] In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[14][15] In 2020, he was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of over $26 million.[16][17] Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable cricketers, with estimated earnings of ₹165 crore (US$21 million) in the year 2022.irat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi to a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[20] Kohli's formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[21] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.</p>

        <p>In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created and on 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young boy. However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.[23] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in the gully cricket.[24] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals, as he was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit and overcome the system of nepotism and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Kohli persisted and eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[25] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[26] As per Sharma's recollection of Kohli's initial days at his academy, he exuded remarkable talent, making it arduous for the coach to curb his enthusiasm. Kohli remained prepared to bat at any position, and often, Sharma had to physically coerce him to leave the training sessions, as he was reluctant to depart.[27] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[24] Kohli's ardent passion for cricket compelled him to travel long distances with his father to ensure that he never missed a match. With time, he diligently honed his skills and diversified his range of shots, commanding respect from the local bowlers.[28]

On the 18th of December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[24][29] During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at times.</p>

        <p>Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a Polly Umrigar match against the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a total of fifteen runs. His first half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Harayana.[32] By the end of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[33] During the 2003–04 season, Kohli was appointed as the captain of the under-15 team. In his first match of the season, he scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[34][35][a] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi under-17 team. In the four matches that he played, Kohli accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251* runs. The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field.[37][38] In the 2005–06 season, Kohli commenced his innings with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[39] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[40]

            On the 18th of February, 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Tophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.[41] In 2006, Kohli had garnered enough attention to earn a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on the 23rd of November, 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs.[42] In a sequence of three matches, Kohli failed to score a fifty, leading his coaches to provide him with counselling. In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, that very night, Kohli's father passed away at 3:54 a.m. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed.[43] The team's coach, Chetan Chauhan was impressed by Kohli's resolute determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad also lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval.[44] Following his dismissal, Kohli immediately attended his father's funeral. His innings, however, proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The team's captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team's success.[44]

            Kohli's foray into T20 cricket took place in April 2007, during the Inter-State T20 Championship, where he emerged as the top run-getter for his team with a tally of 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[45] In September 2008, Kohli played in Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (reigning champions of the of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan). He emerged as the leading scorer for Delhi in both innings, registering 52 runs in the first innings and a towering 197 in the second. The match ultimately ended in a draw, SNGPL being declared the victors due to their lead in first innings.[46] In the 2009–10 Ranji Trophy season, Kohli returned to domestic cricket. During a match against Maharastra, he opened the batting and scored 67 runs, helping Delhi to secure the bonus point required for victory.[47] Kohli's performance reinvigorated the competitive spirit of the domestic cricket circuit. Ashish Nehra observed his growth over time and shared his thoughts:I did not see him waste his time. If not on the field, he would be busy in the gym. I saw him first as a chubby-cheeked bubbly young kid who grew into a perfect athlete. His junior cricket lessons have obviously helped him. I did not now him well, but had heard a lot about his exploits in junior cricket.</p>
